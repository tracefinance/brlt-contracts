## Current Status

The project is in the **early development phase** with focus on the following areas:

1. **User Management** - 70% Complete
   - Core functionality implemented
   - Missing advanced features and testing

2. **Authentication** - 60% Complete
   - Basic OAuth2 implementation in place
   - Needs additional security enhancements and testing

3. **Smart Contracts** - 40% Complete
   - Basic structure defined
   - Core functionality needs implementation

4. **Wallet Management** - 10% Complete
   - Initial planning and design
   - Implementation not yet started

5. **Blockchain Integration** - 10% Complete
   - Interface definitions established
   - Implementation not yet started

6. **Frontend Development** - 5% Complete
   - Project structure set up
   - No significant implementation yet

## Known Issues

1. **Database Performance**
   - SQLite may have concurrent access limitations
   - May need to consider migration path to a more robust database for production

2. **Key Management**
   - Current key storage mechanism needs comprehensive security review
   - Backup and recovery procedures for keys not yet defined

3. **OAuth2 Implementation**
   - Token refresh mechanism needs review
   - Additional OAuth2 flows may be needed for different client types

4. **Contract Gas Optimization**
   - Current contract implementation not optimized for gas usage
   - May need refactoring for production efficiency

5. **Cross-Chain Testing**
   - Testing across multiple networks not yet implemented
   - May reveal network-specific issues

6. **Development Environment**
