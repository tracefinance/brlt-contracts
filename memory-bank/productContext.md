# Vault0 Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Vault0 was created to address a critical gap in the cryptocurrency wallet ecosystem: the tension between security and usability. Traditional cryptocurrency wallets face several challenges:

1. **Single Point of Failure**: Most wallets rely on a single private key, creating a significant vulnerability if that key is compromised.
2. **Irrecoverable Access**: Loss of private keys often means permanent loss of funds with no recovery mechanism.
3. **Limited Institutional Use**: Existing solutions lack the governance and authorization controls needed for business or institutional use.
4. **Cross-Chain Complexity**: Managing assets across different blockchain networks creates fragmented user experiences.

## Problems Vault0 Solves

### Security Without Sacrificing Accessibility
By implementing a dual-signature system, Vault0 eliminates the single point of failure while maintaining accessibility. The requirement for both client and manager signatures creates a balanced security model that protects against:
- Account compromises
- Social engineering attacks
- Internal threats within organizations

### Robust Recovery Mechanism
The 72-hour timelock recovery process provides a safety net that balances two critical needs:
- Allowing legitimate recovery of funds when needed
- Providing sufficient time to detect and stop unauthorized recovery attempts

### Enterprise-Grade Controls
Vault0 enables organizations to implement proper governance controls through:
- Separation of duties (client/manager roles)
- Transaction timeouts (24-hour expiration)
- Token whitelisting for compliance purposes
- Comprehensive event logging for audit trails

### Unified Cross-Chain Experience
By supporting multiple EVM-compatible chains (Base and Polygon zkEVM), Vault0 provides a consistent experience regardless of the underlying blockchain network.

## How It Should Work

### User Flows

#### Wallet Creation
1. User registers on the platform
2. System generates cryptographic key pairs for the user
3. Keys are encrypted and stored securely
4. Smart contract wallet is deployed on selected blockchain networks

#### Withdrawal Process
1. Client initiates a withdrawal request specifying amount, recipient, and token
2. Request is recorded with a 24-hour expiration period
3. Manager reviews and approves the withdrawal with their signature
4. Smart contract verifies both signatures before executing the transfer

#### Recovery Process
1. Recovery can be initiated if normal withdrawal is not possible
2. 72-hour timelock begins when recovery is initiated
3. All stakeholders are notified of pending recovery
4. If no objections are raised during the timelock period, funds can be recovered

### Integration Points

1. **Blockchain Networks**: Direct integration with Base and Polygon zkEVM networks
2. **Token Standards**: Support for native coins and ERC20 tokens
3. **Authentication Systems**: OAuth2 support for secure user authentication
4. **Key Management**: Flexible key storage with multiple implementation options

## User Experience Goals

### For End Users

1. **Simplicity Despite Complexity**: Abstract the technical complexity of multi-signature operations behind an intuitive interface
2. **Confidence in Security**: Provide clear visibility into the dual-signature process and security measures
3. **Control with Guardrails**: Offer flexibility while maintaining appropriate security controls
4. **Cross-Chain Consistency**: Ensure the user experience remains consistent regardless of the blockchain network

### For Organizations

1. **Governance Implementation**: Enable proper financial controls and approval workflows
2. **Audit Capabilities**: Provide comprehensive logging and tracking of all wallet operations
3. **Customizable Security**: Allow adjustments to security parameters based on risk appetite
4. **Compliance Support**: Facilitate regulatory compliance through whitelisting and controlled operations

### For Developers

1. **Extensible Architecture**: Enable integration with other systems and services
2. **Clear Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation of all components
3. **Testability**: Support thorough testing of all system components
4. **Modularity**: Allow components to be extended or replaced as needed
