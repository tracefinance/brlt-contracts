# Vault0 Project Brief

## Project Overview
Vault0 is a secure, dual-signature cryptocurrency wallet smart contract system with a robust recovery mechanism. It implements a multi-signature wallet that requires two authorizations (client and manager) to withdraw funds, with additional security features such as timelock-based recovery and token whitelisting.

## Core Requirements

1. **Multi-Signature Security System**
   - Dual-signature requirement between client and manager for withdrawals
   - 72-hour timelock recovery mechanism
   - 24-hour expiration for withdrawal requests

2. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Support for Base and Polygon zkEVM networks
   - Transactions for native coins (ETH) and ERC20 tokens
   - Token whitelisting functionality

3. **Secure Key Management**
   - Encrypted key storage using AES-GCM encryption
   - Multiple key storage mechanism support
   - Environment-based encryption key

4. **Full-Stack Architecture**
   - Smart Contracts: Solidity-based multi-signature wallet
   - Backend API: Go-based server for wallet management
   - Frontend UI: Next.js with React for user interactions

5. **Security Requirements**
   - Reentrancy attack protection
   - Comprehensive event logging
   - Controlled token support through whitelisting
   - Secure authentication with OAuth2 support

## Project Goals

1. **Security**: Create a wallet system that eliminates single-point-of-failure risks through multi-signature requirements.

2. **Recoverability**: Implement robust recovery mechanisms that balance security with practical usability.

3. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Support multiple Ethereum-compatible networks to provide flexibility.

4. **User Experience**: Develop an intuitive interface that makes complex blockchain operations accessible.

5. **Modularity**: Build components in a modular way to allow for future extensions and customizations.

## Success Criteria

1. Successful deployment of smart contracts on target networks
2. Complete implementation of dual-signature authorization flow
3. Functional recovery mechanism with appropriate timelock
4. Secure key management with encrypted storage
5. User-friendly interface for wallet operations
6. Comprehensive testing coverage (90%+ for contracts)
7. Documentation of all system components and flows
