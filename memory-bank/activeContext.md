# Vault0 Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on the **user management** and **authentication** components of the Vault0 backend. This includes:

1. **User Service Implementation**
   - User data model and database schema
   - Repository layer for user data persistence
   - Service layer implementing user business logic
   - API handlers for user-related endpoints

2. **OAuth2 Authentication System**
   - OAuth2 server implementation
   - Token generation and validation
   - Authentication middleware
   - Integration with the user service

## Recent Changes

### User Management Implementation

- Created database schema for users table
- Implemented user model with core fields
- Developed user repository for database operations
- Implemented user service with business logic
- Created API handlers for user endpoints

### Authentication System

- Set up OAuth2 server configuration
- Implemented token generation and validation
- Created handlers for authentication endpoints
- Integrated authentication with user service

## Next Steps

1. **Complete User Management**
   - Implement remaining user endpoints
   - Add validation for user input
   - Implement user profile management
   - Add unit and integration tests

2. **Wallet Management**
   - Design wallet data model and schema
   - Implement wallet repository
   - Develop wallet service with business logic
   - Create API handlers for wallet operations

3. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Implement blockchain service
   - Integrate with wallet operations
   - Set up contract interactions
   - Develop transaction submission flow

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Create user authentication flows
   - Implement wallet management UI
   - Develop transaction creation and approval interfaces
   - Set up blockchain integration on the client side

## Version Control Practices

**Decision**: Use Angular commit convention for descriptive and structured commit messages.

**Format**:
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

**Benefits**:
- Enables automated changelog generation
- Provides clear history of changes
- Enforces structured commit messages
- Improves project maintainability

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Strategy

**Decision**: Use OAuth2 for authentication with JWT tokens.

**Considerations**:
- OAuth2 provides a standardized authentication flow
- JWT tokens are stateless and can be validated without database lookups
- Refresh tokens allow for extended sessions without compromising security
- Integration with multiple client types (web, mobile) is straightforward

### Database Schema Design

**Decision**: Use a normalized database schema with separate tables for users, wallets, keys, and transactions.

**Considerations**:
- Normalized structure improves data integrity
- Separate concerns for different entity types
- Foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity
- Allows for efficient querying of related data

### Key Management Approach

**Decision**: Use encrypted database storage for private keys with AES-GCM encryption.

**Considerations**:
- Database storage provides persistence and backup capabilities
- Encryption ensures keys are secure at rest
- Environment-based encryption key improves security
- Multiple storage mechanisms can be implemented through the keystore interface

### API Design Pattern

**Decision**: Implement a RESTful API with standardized response formats.

**Considerations**:
- REST provides a familiar and widely understood API pattern
- Standard response formats improve client integration
- HTTP status codes communicate outcomes clearly
- Endpoint structure maps well to resource operations

## Critical Path Items

1. **User Authentication**
   - Required for all secured endpoints
   - Foundational for user-specific operations
   - Needed for proper access control

2. **Wallet Creation**
   - Core functionality for the application
   - Prerequisite for any transaction operations
   - Requires integration with blockchain networks

3. **Transaction Signing**
   - Central value proposition of the multi-signature wallet
   - Requires both user and blockchain integration
   - Critical security component

4. **Smart Contract Deployment**
   - Required for actual on-chain wallet functionality
   - Must be tested thoroughly before mainnet deployment
   - Needs appropriate configuration for different networks
